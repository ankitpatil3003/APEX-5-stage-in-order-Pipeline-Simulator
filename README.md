# APEX-5-stage-in-order-Pipeline-Simulator

●	Build a C++ 5-stage comprehensive pipeline simulator implementing a cycle-by-cycle execution model with BTB.

●	Supported the execution of 26 unique types of instructions via fetch, decode, execute, memory & writeback stages.

●	Constructed the simulator by adding architecture-specific features to improve the simulation's fidelity, such as process execution, dependencies, register retrieval, write-back operations and adding bubbles if required.
